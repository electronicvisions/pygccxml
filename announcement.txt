Hello!

I'm pleased to announce the 0.8.5 release of pygccxml. 

What is pygccxml?
=================

"...The purpose of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of a 
C++ program from GCC's internal representation. "

-- Introduction to GCC-XML

The purpose of pygccxml is to read a generated file and provide a simple 
framework to navigate C++ declarations, using Python classes.

Where is pygccxml?
==================

What's new?
===========

Features 
--------

* Added new functionality: "I depend on them". Every declaration can report 
  types and declarations it depends on. This functionality helps code generators.
  For example, Py++, the Boost.Python code generator, uses it to verify that all 
  relevant declarations were exposed.

* Declarations, read from GCC-XML generated file, could be saved in cache.

Small features
--------------
* New type traits have been added:

   * is_bool

* Small improvement to algorithm, which extracts value_type
  ( mapped_type ) from "std" containers.

* Few aliases to long method name were introduced:

   ============================= ==========================
               Name                        Alias
   ============================= ==========================
    scopedef_t.variable           scopedef_t.var
    scopedef_t.variables          scopedef_t.vars
    scopedef_t.member_function    scopedef_t.mem_fun
    scopedef_t.member_functions   scopedef_t.mem_funs
    scopedef_t.free_function      scopedef_t.free_fun
    scopedef_t.free_functions     scopedef_t.free_funs
   ============================= ==========================

Bug fixes
---------

* "signed char" and "char" are two different types. This bug was fixed and
  now pygccxml treats them right. Many thanks to Gaetan Lehmann for reporting
  the bug.

* Fixing bug related to array size and cache.
